How to start up zedboard on Linux ubuntu.


1. Plug in the power and JTAG input.  The JTag input should flash with the USB
cable is connected.  If it doesn't replace the cable.  Without this serial
communication fails.

1a.  To see that the USB is connected you can type:
dmesg | grep tty
[    0.176277] printk: console [tty0] enabled
[    0.826184] serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
[    0.846636] serial8250: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
[  176.704994] cdc_acm 3-3:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

You should see a USB ACM device.  Don't know what the tty S1 S0 devices are but
they are not external usb devices.  The last has to be ttyACM0.

1b.  The LED display should be powered off before shutting off.  By trial and
error BTN7 to left of DIgilent display shuts power off of it.  If nothing else
this will shut off the display.

2. Jumpers are set MO5 M04 set on 3.3 V rest at zero.  Also JP6 is set
connected.


3.  Minicom is the serial port program.  


This is described here:

In the back is the linux set up.

4.  Power on the Zedboard and let it boot up.  Once it is booted up it will
establish a connection to the tty0 port.  This was set up in minicom earlier.

4a.  Connect a 9 pin serial cable to the main Acer monitor.  Now you can use the
input button on the bottom to see the digilent output.  This button toggles
zedborad and main computer.    To get back to computer need to hit this button
and then hit the space bar of the keyboard.

5. In an open terminal now run minicom.  You will see  help controal A Z and  a
menu. I already set minicoms parameters so that need not be adjusted.  Now the
zedboard is connected.

6.  Once minicom is connected can hit enter and get prompt.  boot will reboot
and now the digilent display lights up.  I get the zynq prompt after command
boot.
