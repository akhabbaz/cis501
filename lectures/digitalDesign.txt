2.5   comment to take the compliment, take the dual and complement each literal.

This is true because

(AB)'  = A' + B'   and (A+B)' = A' * B' by deMorgan's Theorem

If A and B are both simple literals it certainly works.  Also works for (ABC)'.
If any of them is complex applying Demorgans once would lead to a simplification
where C (say is complex is isolated), so now we would have C'.  Applying again
the dual formula would work and would break up C into simple literals and the
conjugate of a complex term.  Breaking up C would mean taking the dual and
complimenting each literal.  This will keep working until there are no complex
terms left.

sum of minterms

consider nor

a = 0, b = 0 , f (out) = 0  other cases f(out) = 1 (or gate)

f' = a' * b'   f' is true low only when both a and b are true (low)i


product of max terms:

The only way for a function to be 1 is if all the zero producing terms fail.

(x+y+z) *.....  f1.  If all are zero the first maxterm is 0 so the product will
be zero
