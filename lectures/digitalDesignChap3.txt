Wired AND logic


consider an Nand gate where  A, B are in series n type FET, C, D are in series
n type FETs. The outputs are wired together.  This makes AB forms an open
collector NAND. Both gates need to be high for the gate to be low.   The wired
connection becomes and AND gate.  For the output to be high, at least one of A,
B must be low and at least one of C, D must be low.  If C, D are both high F
will be low.  Here There will be an open gate to ground.   Because it is open
collector, there the out may be shorted but no gates are fighting each other;
just one or both paths may recieve current.


The wired or is still connected together but the output is an ecl gate.  It
looks the emmitters are tied together.  

The nor would be A, B p type gates in series, connected to the Vcc. If A or B is high the output is
low. The only way for the output to be high is if both A, B are low.  In that
case, the emitter would go high. his is a nor. 

Now tie together two emitters, one from A, B and the next from C, D.  If A, B are both 0 then one
gate is open and the output will be high. It doesn't matter about C or D. C and
D both could be low and in that case the output is high no matter A, B.
